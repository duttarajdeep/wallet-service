# 🧾 Day 4 Log - Swagger Integration + GitHub Actions OpenAPI Export

📅 Date: 2025-06-22

## ✅ Goals Achieved

- Integrated Swagger UI using `springdoc-openapi`
- Annotated controller and DTOs with `@Tag`, `@Operation`, `@Schema` for rich API docs
- Verified OpenAPI spec loads correctly at `/v3/api-docs` and `/swagger-ui/index.html`
- Wrote `SwaggerUiTest.java` as a smoke test for documentation endpoints
- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow to:
  - Build & test the Spring Boot project
  - Spin up the app, download `/v3/api-docs.yaml`
  - Upload OpenAPI spec as an artifact on every push/PR
- Adapted workflow to `master` branch instead of `main`

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

| Area | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| Swagger Integration | Used `springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui:2.3.0` | Fully supports Spring Boot 3.2+ |
| Annotations | Used `@Tag`, `@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@Schema` | Better documentation, easier onboarding |
| Test Coverage | Wrote smoke tests for `/swagger-ui` and `/v3/api-docs` | Ensure docs remain available in prod |
| CI/CD | Used GitHub Actions with artifact upload | Simple, fast, no Jenkins infra overhead |
| Branch Target | Switched workflow to run on `master` branch | Matches current repository default |

## 🧪 Example Swagger UI

- URL: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
- Interactive API docs with schema previews, example inputs, response wrappers

## 🔄 GitHub Actions Artifact

- On every push to `master`, `openapi.yaml` is exported and downloadable
- Stored under the "Artifacts" section in the GitHub Actions UI

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `SwaggerUiTest.java` in `docs` test package
- Annotated:
  - `WalletController.java`
  - `AccountRequest.java`

## 📌 Tomorrow's Plan (Day 5)

- Add endpoints for debit/credit operations
- Expand domain logic
- Update OpenAPI spec and tests accordingly
